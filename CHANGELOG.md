## v4.2.0 (February 2020)

* Added ability to disable the creation of the resource with variable `create_cf`, defaults to `true`
* Adding possibility to add additional tags
* Inside `ordered_cache_behavior` & `default_cache_behavior` made these variables optional: `compress`, `headers`, `min_ttl`, `max_ttl`, `default_ttl`, also made `lambda_function_association` optional, now possible not to specify it at all
* Inside `lambda_function_association`, made the variable `include_body` optional
* Inside `logging_config`, the variables `include_cookies` & `prefix` are now optional
* `origin_group` is now optional
* `logging_config` & `default_cache_behavior` are not iterating anymore (as there can be only max one of these configs)
